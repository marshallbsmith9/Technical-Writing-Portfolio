# IoT Smart Cities Report

This folder contains a final academic report focused on Internet of Things (IoT) applications within smart city infrastructures. The project examined how sensor networks, data collection, and analytics can be leveraged to improve efficiency, sustainability, and decision-making in urban environments.

## Project Overview
The report explores the role of IoT technologies in modern smart cities, including:
- Data collection through distributed sensor systems
- Integration of real-time and historical data
- Applications in transportation, energy, public safety, and urban planning

## Key Topics Covered
- Technical and analytical writing
- Systems-level thinking across technology and policy
- Ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly
- Integration of data, computation, and real-world applications

This report demonstrates my ability to analyze emerging technologies and articulate their implications through structured, professional technical writing.
